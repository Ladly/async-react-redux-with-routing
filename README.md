# Webpack React-redux with async calls and basic routing Boilerplate



https://github.com/Ladly/webpack-react-redux-bolerplate extended with promise and thunk middleware for async actions, and with basing routing with react router

ATM no need for something robust and complicated like redux-saga. Also routing is handled using react-router-dom which works fine but it is not best way but will suffice for now

There is also example for every library used

learning purpuse- not suitable for production


use:

    - npm/yarn install

    - npm/yarn run dev

    - go nuts
